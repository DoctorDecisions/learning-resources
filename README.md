# Welcome to the EvidenceCare virtual library!

This is a place for the EvidenceCare Engineering Team to accumulate resources they have found helpful with our current and future tech stack.

### Folder Structure

Each folder represents an area of knowledge we feel is required for working in our environment and each of those folders will contain a file of each type of resource (which may or may not contain a table at this point):

* books
* courses
* links
* repos
* tutorials

Not all resources fit in a single type or even single folder, which is why you may find the same resource in multiple places.

### SUBMIT!

Feel free to submit a PR to this repo to share resources or if you'd rather send something directly to Eliot on Slack or email. After all, this is supposed to be a collection of our shared knowledge!!

## Thanks for reading and happy resource hunting!
